[Link to practice problem](https://neetcode.io/problems/prototype)

Small C++ program implementing the Prototype pattern.

The Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows an object to copy itself. It is particularly useful when the creation of an object is more convenient through copying an existing object than through creation from scratch.

To compile and run:
```
g++ main.cpp
./a.out
```
